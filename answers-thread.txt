A key miss can happen when:
- Both Thread 1 and Thread 2 are in the middle of inserting a key, at the same time,
- Thread 1 updates the head of the linked list to its newly created entry. 
- Thread 2 updates the head of the linked list to its new created entry, overwriting Thread 1's update. 
The total effect is that Thread 1's update to the hashtable is lost.
